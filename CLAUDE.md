# sideclaw — Developer Notes

## Architecture

React frontend (Vite) + Bun/Elysia backend, running natively on the host.
Served on `http://sideclaw.local` (localias proxy → port 7705).

Bun loads `.env` automatically from the `sideclaw/` directory — all env vars
(`PERSONAL_REPOS_PATH`, `WORK_REPOS_PATH`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`) live there.

## Running sideclaw

**sideclaw runs exclusively via LaunchAgent. Never start it standalone.**

- `make dev` and `make start` are intentionally broken — they exit with an error.
- Do NOT run `bun run dev`, `bun run start`, `bun server/index.ts`, or anything that starts a server directly.
- Port 7705 is owned by the LaunchAgent. Starting a second process there causes conflicts.

```bash
make build           # Build frontend to dist/ (no server start)
make reload          # After code changes: build + kickstart LaunchAgent
make install-agent   # One-time: build + install + start LaunchAgent
make uninstall-agent # Remove LaunchAgent

tail -f /tmp/sideclaw.log   # stdout
tail -f /tmp/sideclaw.err   # stderr
```

The LaunchAgent starts automatically on login and restarts on crash.

## Git Workflow

Direct-to-master repo — no PRs, no releases, no validation step.

```
/review   → optional code review before committing
/commit   → commit changes
/ship     → review → commit → push (skips /check, PR, and release steps)
```

Never create feature branches or PRs. No lint, format, or typecheck configured — `/check` is skipped entirely.

## Fullscreen (kiosk mode)

The DiagramPanel fullscreen button tries the native browser Fullscreen API first.
In WebKit-based browsers (e.g. CMUX) that don't expose it, the frontend calls
`GET /api/open-kiosk?url=<current-url>` — the Elysia backend spawns Chrome with
`--kiosk --user-data-dir=/tmp/sideclaw-kiosk` on the host. Tries regular Chrome,
Chromium, then Playwright Chrome for Testing. Falls back to CSS focus mode if
no binary is found. **Exit kiosk:** `Cmd+Q`.

## Validating UI Changes

In dev: changes reflect immediately via Vite HMR at the dev server port.
In prod: `make build` + reload `http://sideclaw.local` in browser.
Use the Chrome MCP extension for visual validation via screenshots.
